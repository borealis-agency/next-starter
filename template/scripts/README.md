# Scripts

Custom scripts used to automate certain manual workflows in the project. These should not be edited.

If edits are truly necessary, they might have to be applied to the [Borealis Next.js Starter Template](https://github.com/borealis-agency/next-starter) repo if they provide value for future projects. This should be discussed before making changes to that template repo.
